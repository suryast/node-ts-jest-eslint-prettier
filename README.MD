This boilerplate can be expanded to include popular frontend libraries like React or Vue.

Afterward the installation step, the following script commands are available for you:

-  Run the project locally `npm run start:prod`
-  Run all tests `npm run test`
-  Build the javascript bundles for production `npm run build`
