This is a boilerplate template for creating a Typescipt project that also includes the following libraries:
-  Jest – for writing unit tests 
-  eslint – adapting airbnb linting rules
-  Prettier – code autoformat

This boilerplate can be expanded to include popular frontend libraries like React or Vue.

The following commands are available for you:

-  Run the project locally `npm run start:prod`
-  Run all tests `npm run test`
-  Build the javascript bundles for production `npm run build`
-  Check that all files follow the linting rules `npm run lint`
-  Debug `npm run debug`

Other available commands can be found inside `package.json`.
